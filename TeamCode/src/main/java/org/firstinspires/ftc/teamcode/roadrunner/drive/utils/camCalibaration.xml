        This file can provide additional camera calibration settings beyond those built into the SDK itself.
        Each calibration is for a particular camera (indicated by USB vid & pid pair) and a particular
        capture resolution for the camera. Note: it is very important when capturing images used to calibrate
        a camera that the image acquisition tool can actually control this capture resolution within the camera
        itself and that you use this setting correctly. Many image acquistion tools do not in fact provide
        this level of control.

        Beyond simply providing additional, new camera calibrations, calibrations provided herein can
        *replace/update* those that are builtin to the SDK. This matching is keyed, of course, by the
        (vid, pid, size) triple. Further, if such a calibration has the 'remove' attribute with value 'true',
        any existing calibration with that key is removed (and the calibration itself not added).

        Calibrations are internally processed according to aspect ratio. If a format is requested in a size
        that is not calibrated, but a calibration does exist for the same aspect ratio on the same camera,
        then the latter will be scaled to accommodate the request. For example, if a 640x480 calibration
        is requested but only a 800x600 calibration exists for that camera, then the 800x600 is scaled
        down to service the 640x480 request.

        Further, it is important to note that if *no* calibrations exist for a given camera, then Vuforia
        is offered the entire range of capture resolutions that the hardware can support (and it does its
        best to deal with the lack of calibration). However, if *any* calibrations are provided for a camera,
        then capture resolutions in those aspect ratios supported by the camera for which any calibrations
        are *not* provided are *not* offered. Thus, if you calibrate a camera but fail to calibrate all
        the camera's supported aspect ratios, you limit the choices of capture resolutions that Vuforia can
        select from.

        One image acquisition program that supports control of camera capture resolution is YouCam 7:
        https://www.cyberlink.com/products/youcam/features_en_US.html

        Programs that can process acquired images to determine camera calibration settings include:
        https://www.3dflow.net/3df-zephyr-free/ (see "Utilities/Images/Launch Camera Calibration" therein)
        http://graphics.cs.msu.ru/en/node/909
        Note that the type of images that must be acquired in order to calibrate is specific to the
        calibration software used.

        The required contents are illustrated here by example. Note that for the attribute names, both the
        camelCase or the underscore_variations are supported; they are equivalent. The attributes for
        each Calibration are as follows:

        size (int pair): space separated camera resolution (width, height).
        focalLength (float pair): space separated focal length value.
        principalPoint (float pair): space separated principal point values (width, height).
        distortionCoefficients (an 8-element float array): distortion coefficients in the following form
        (r:radial, t:tangential): [r0, r1, t0, t1, r2, r3, r4, r5]
        see https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/modules/calib3d/doc/camera_calibration_and_3d_reconstruction.html

        The examples here are commented out as the values are built-in to the FTC SDK. They serve instead
        here as examples on how make your own.
